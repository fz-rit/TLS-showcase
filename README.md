# ðŸŒ¿ Mapping the Wild: 3D Forest Ecology with LiDAR âœ¨

Welcome to our project! This repository features research from Dr. Jan van Aardtâ€™s lab at Rochester Institute of Technology, where we explore forest ecosystems in 3D using terrestrial LiDAR and machine learning.

From the temperate woodlands of Harvard Forest to the tropical mangroves of Palau, we study forest structureâ€”canopy, stems, understory, ground, and moreâ€”to support ecological monitoring, modeling, and conservation.

Our goal: Make forests measurable, mappable, and meaningful using cutting-edge 3D technologies.

Feel free to explore and connect!

**Through the Laserâ€™s Eye**

**[Verse 1]**  
Down a quiet trail, where the shadows lie,  
I see the woods through a laserâ€™s eye.  
No rustlinâ€™ leaves, no evening breeze,  
But every root and branch is freezinâ€™ time with ease.  

**[Verse 2]**  
The trees stand tall in lines of light,  
No sun above, no day or night.  
Yet every limb and twist and bend  
Gets captured true like an old-time friend.  

**[Chorus]**  
Through the laserâ€™s eye, I see the past,  
Every tree and trail built to last.  
Itâ€™s not just lines, itâ€™s where life stoodâ€”  
A quiet map of the neighborhood.  
It holds the echoes, still and wideâ€”  
Of stories the forest used to hide.
